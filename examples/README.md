# Examples

## Overview

The `examples` folder contains sample applications demonstrating the usage of the `libnoise` library for procedural content generation. These examples include generating terrains (`worms`, `complexplanet`) and textures (`texturejade`, `texturegranite`, `texturewood`, `texturesky`, `textureslime`), showcasing practical applications of noise modules in games, simulations, and visualizations.

These examples are modernized versions of the originals created by **Jason Bevins** in 2005, updated by **TEK Nemesis** for C++17 compliance and cross-platform compatibility as part of `libnoise-modern` (version 1.1.0). The original versions and their detailed descriptions are available at [libnoise.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html](https://libnoise.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html).

## Building and Running

To build the examples, use the build scripts in the main `libnoise-modern` folder (`../`):

- **Windows**: Run `build_windows.bat` and select option 3 (Shared Library with `libnoise`, `noiseutils`, and examples).
- **Linux**: Run `./build_linux.sh` and select option 3.

The compiled executables (e.g., `worms.exe` on Windows, `worms` on Linux) will be placed in the `bin` folder. Run them directly to see the generated outputs, which may include noise maps, images, or terrain files (e.g., BMP, RAW).

## SourceForge Reference

For detailed explanations of each example, including their noise module configurations and output descriptions, refer to the original documentation at [libnoise.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html](https://libnoise.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html). Note that the SourceForge examples reflect the 2005 versions, while these have been updated for modern C++ standards and compatibility.

## Examples Included

- `worms.cpp`: Demonstrates an unusual application of libnoise to render and animate worm-like creatures in real time.
- `complexplanet.cpp`: Creates a complex planetary terrain with multiple noise layers.
- `texturejade.cpp`, `texturegranite.cpp`, `texturewood.cpp`, `texturesky.cpp`, `textureslime.cpp`: Create procedural textures generated by libnoise.
